    <h1>TOP 5 UNDERRATED MUSIC VIDEOS</h1>
    <h3>Music Videos, the combination of song and video. Some of the earliest films were a subset of music videos. By the 50s and 60s artists began experimenting with music video production. Then by the 80s, with the launch of MTV they became a commercial asset to the music industry, a necessity</h3>
    <h2>This is a list of some of my favoite music videos that I don't think enough people are talking about, even though they should.</h2>

    <h2 class="Orbitron-normal">Intergalactic by Beastie Boys (1998)</h2>
    <h3 class="Orbitron-normal">The Beastie Boys are well known for their other music videos like, "Fight for Your Right" or "Sabatoge." Yet, Intergalactic is an often overlooked music video.</h3>
    <p>This video has a wonderful combination of narrative and experimental style. There are basically two videos that were filmed. First, is the narrative kaiju battle, where a robot is brought down to Tokyo, Japan to fight off an evil monster. Second, is the new-wave esque footage of the beastie boys walking through Tokyo in their "intergalactic" costumes. This section has a great combination of 90s hip hop and 80s new wave style.</p>

            <h2>Babooshka by Kate Bush (1980)</h2>
    <h3>Kate Bush, an incredible artist, well-known for her song "Running Up That Hill," which made a resurgence in pop-culture in 2020. This video is a master class in the Kate Bush style: it's weird, stylistic and dance heavy.</h3>
    <p>Babooshka is experimental film that tells the story of two people: a wife and her alter ego "Babooshka" that is writing her husband anonymous love letters. This video is split into two sections, one featuring the wife and the other featuring the embodiment of "Babooshka". This video does a great job of reflecting the narrative of the song, using the lyrics ot guide the piece. And, the dancing is highly reflective of her instructor, Lindsay Kemp.</p>

    <h2>Last Nite by The Strokes (2001)</h2>
     <h3>The Strokes are an alt/indie band that's well known for the distorted vocals. This video is necessarily uknown, but I think more people should be recognizing how well this piece represents the band.</h3>
    <p>This video takes place on a single set, creating a live tv performance feel. The band is on the stage and are unenthusiastically playing live. There are two incredible parts happening in this video. 1. The band is playing live, this version of the song was created for the video. 2. The band is actively drinking udring the performance. I think this video is a great representation of the band and their "I don't care" attitude.</p>

    <h2>Get Down On It by Kool and the Gang (1981)</h2>
        <h3>This is one of my favorite songs by Kool and the Gang. After researching them further, I found this video, which I think is just an incredible performance from the group.</h3>
    <p>Get Down on It uses some kind of distortion filter on the video to infinitely duplicate the recording of them playing. The video becomes so distorted that it becomes difficult to understand what's going on. I think this style is so cool and reflects the previous era of experimentation in music videos that Kool and the Gang are following.</p>

    <h2>Lady (Hear Me Tonight) by Modjo (2013)</h2>
    <h3>Absolute banger. This video is quite possibly one of the greatest of all time and should be talked about more.</h3>
    <p>Lady by Modjo is an amazing song and the music video makes it even better. It follows a group of three as they travel around and get into trouble. The narrative aspct of this piece, following these characters around is incredible engaging. It gives viewers something to follow along, with an already incredible song. It reflects their indie style very well.</p>
